<br />
<em>1.3	Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications</em>
<br />
Assignment 2 was where really felt I was getting hands-on experience in developing software applications. Here I felt as if the training wheels came off and I could not simply copy some code from a lab or from ChatGPT. In particular, to get the product quantities a user selected through the login and registration to the invoice helped me understand the basic software development process of first thinking though what is wanted, then deciding how to do it, and only after this writing the code to do it. Writing my comments first help organize and focus this process.*
