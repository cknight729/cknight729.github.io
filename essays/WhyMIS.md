Why did I choose MIS? My lazy response is that I just want to go to work already and so I just wanted to get a degree in something and start from there. I did choose this degree however as I do believe I am somewhat proficient in IT but also liked the flexibility offered if for whatever reason I wanted to do a more administration oriented job which I was contemplating as well. Maybe I'm a little misguided and unmotivated but I do like tech and helping others find new ways to improve workflow or solve issues.
