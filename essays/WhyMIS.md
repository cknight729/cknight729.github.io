Why did I choose MIS? In choosing my degree, I do believe I am somewhat proficient in IT but also liked the flexibility offered if for whatever reason I wanted to do a more administration oriented job which I was contemplating as well. Perhaps I'm a little misguided and unmotivated. I do however like tech and helping others find new ways to improve workflow or solve issues. I've recently taken up MIS 431 as well and find that class and its instructor to be very enjoyable. Maybe networking sounds more interesting? Regardless, technology will continue to progress forward and be a continuingly growing field of work and so I wanted to be able to take part in its growth and apply it to people worldwide.
